Use velocity control(?) to speed up sonar's motor
Increase degree interval to 5+ degrees
Histogram for WP 2 and 3 will therefore be hard to distinguish:
	Need to determine an 'epsilon' value for if the difference between any two WPs is small
	Compare depth measurements for those waypoints
Increasing degree interval will decrease orientation precision
	Use techniques from practical5 to determine orientation using sonar reading against wall
	By using the estimated orientation to determine the facing wall
